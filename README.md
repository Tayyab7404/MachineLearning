# **Machine Learning**

### List of Programs:

1. Implement and demonstrate the Find-S algorithm to find the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of data samples. Read the training data from a csv file.
2. For a given set of training data examples stored in a csv file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.
3. Write a program to implement the Naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training dataset stored as a csv file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test datasets.
4. Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the Naïve Bayesian classifier model to perform this task. Built-in classes/API can be used to write the program. Calculate the accuracy precision and recall for your dataset.
5. Write a program to construct a Bayesian Network considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis the of heart patients using standard heart disease dataset. You can use Python ML Library classes/API.
6. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate dataset for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
7. Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate datasets.
8. Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a csv file. Use the same data set for clustering using K-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering. You can add Python ML library classes/API in the program.
9. Write a program to implement K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify the iris dataset. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Python ML library classes can be used for this problem.
10. Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm in order to fit data points. Select appropriate dataset your experiment and draw graphs.
